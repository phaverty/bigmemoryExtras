CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.4
--------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o  The updateBackingpaths function allows bulk updating of backingfile directories for a
       collection of BigMatrix objects. Not all objects in the collection must be of the
       BigMatrix type.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT
    o  All Biobase-related content is deprecated including updateAssayDataPaths
       (see updateBackingfiles) and the annotatedDataFrameFrom trick for including
       a BigMatrix in an eSet.

Version 0.1.8: [<- for BigFactorMatrix now converts incoming character value to integer


# Fri 06-07-2013 - 16:50
Version 1.3.1: Object creation functions BigMatrix and BigMatrixFactor can now optionally take a scalar numeric, like NA_real_ as the "x" argument. This will be used to initialize the matrix.


# Thu 06-20-2013 - 11:29
Version 1.4.0: Changed internal representation to optimize handling of dimnames and to eliminate the descriptor file. Be sure to use updateObject on any BigMatrix objects stored on disk. See the vignette for more details.


# Wed 06-26-2013 - 19:56
Version 1.4.1: Better defaults for initial value of BigMatrix and BigMatrixFactor (NA_real_ and NA_integer_).  Giving x=NULL still provides the bigmemory feature of initializing to all zeros instantly.
