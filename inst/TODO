# TODO
#  Think of more setValidity checks
#  Relocate method that moves files *carefully* and resets descpath
#  Use ds$methods("foo" ... to set methods rather than all at once, for readability
#  Setter for levels?  Would that modify data?
#  Move dimnames to BigMatrix object?
#    Getters and setters, save on set, save .self in foo.desc.rds?
#    Use getters for "[" by character
#    Add names upon "["
#  normalizePath on incoming descpath, validObject afterwards?
