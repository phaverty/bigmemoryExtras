Type: Package
Title: An extension of the bigmemory package with added safety, convenience,
    and a factor class.
Version: 1.13.1
Author: Peter M. Haverty
Maintainer: Peter M. Haverty <phaverty@gene.com>
Description: This package defines a "BigMatrix" ReferenceClass which adds
    safety and convenience features to the filebacked.big.matrix class from the
    bigmemory package. BigMatrix protects against segfaults by monitoring and
    gracefully restoring the connection to on-disk data and it also protects
    against accidental data modification with a filesystem-based permissions
    system. We provide utilities for using BigMatrix-derived classes as
    assayData matrices within the Biobase package's eSet family of classes.
    BigMatrix provides some optimizations related to attaching to, and indexing
    into, file-backed matrices with dimnames. Additionally, the package
    provides a "BigMatrixFactor" class, a file-backed matrix with factor
    properties.
